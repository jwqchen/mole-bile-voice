# Standard call sequence during a drag&drop operation

This is a bird view of the common drag&drop method call sequence in Draw2D. I happens a 
lot more stuff inside, but this is a good starting point for a overview.

It is important to understand how the draw2D lib works internal if you want to tweak it for 
your purpose.

Example call if you click on a normal shape and drag&drop them.
