Unlike normal figures, you must not set the bounds of a connection. Instead,\nyou must provide the source and target port and let the connection router calculate the connection's points. The connection\nthen determines its own bounding box.</p>\n\n<p>A connection has a simple router by default - one that can connect the source and target anchors. But additional routers are\navailable and can be set on the connection. Some routers can handle constraints for the connection. Note that when setting\na routing constraint on a connection, you must first set the router which will use that constraint.</p>\n","title":"Connectors"});
